## Description

- Utilizing the provided starter code, I will develop a fully functional Google Books search engine, initially constructed using a RESTful API, and then refactoring it to employ a GraphQL API with Apollo Server integration. The application leverages the MERN stack, comprising a React front end, MongoDB database, and a Node.js/Express.js server and API. The existing architecture facilitates users in saving book searches to the backend seamlessly.

## Installation

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- MongoDB (download from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

- Clone the repository 

- Open your terminal or command prompt, and navigate to the project's root folder using the cd command.


## Usage

- Install the required dependencies by running these commands in the command line after you have performed the instuctions listed for the Installation process.

- npm install
- Start the MongoDB server by running the following command: mongod

-In a separate terminal window, navigate to the server folder and start the backend server by running: npm start

- Open another terminal window, navigate to the client folder and start the frontend server by running: npm start

- The frontend server should open automatically in your default web browser. If it does not, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in the console output).

- You should now have the book search engine up and running. You can use the application to search for books, save them to your list, and manage your saved books.
